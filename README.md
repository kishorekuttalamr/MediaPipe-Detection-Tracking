# Real-Time Multi-Purpose Hand, Body, and Face Tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV

## Project Overview

Welcome to the "Real-Time Multi-Purpose Tracking with MediaPipe and OpenCV" GitHub repository. This repository contains a sophisticated Python script that enables real-time tracking of multiple elements using the MediaPipe library and OpenCV. By seamlessly integrating the MediaPipe Hand, Pose, and Face Mesh modules, this script offers accurate detection and tracking of landmarks across various subjects within video frames.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive into the project, make sure your Python environment meets the following requirements:

- OpenCV (cv2)
- MediaPipe (mediapipe)
- NumPy (numpy)

To install these dependencies effortlessly, execute the following command:

```sh
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Hand Tracking:** The script capitalizes on the advanced capabilities of the MediaPipe Hand module to detect and track landmarks on human hands in real-time.

- **Precise Body Pose Estimation:** Leveraging the integrated MediaPipe Pose module, this script provides accurate estimations of both 2D and 3D poses for human bodies.

- **Dynamic Face Mesh Tracking:** By seamlessly integrating the MediaPipe Face Mesh module, the script dynamically tracks and traces facial landmarks in real-time.

- **Hand Handedness Detection:** This script goes a step further by identifying whether the detected hand is the left or right one, conveniently displaying this information directly on the video frames.

- **Frames Per Second (FPS) Measurement:** Enjoy the benefit of automatic frames per second (FPS) calculation and display on the video frames, helping you gauge the real-time performance.

## Upcoming Enhancements

Stay tuned for our commitment to refining and enhancing this multi-purpose tracking script. We're continuously working to elevate its capabilities and functionalities.
